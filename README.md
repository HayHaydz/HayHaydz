Hey, I'm Haydon.

I'm a Junior Frontend Developer creating websites on the interwebs.

In my spare time I enjoy photography, hiking, reading and watching Anime, currently I'm watching Jujutsu Kaisen S2

You can send me an [email](mailto:haydon.curteis-lateo@outlook.com), look at my photography on ([unsplash](https://unsplash.com/@hayhaydz)/[Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/199728645@N02/)), connect with me on [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hayhaydz/) (or the cooler LinkedIn [read.cv](https://read.cv/hayhaydz)), or just have a browse through some of my work here on GitHub!
